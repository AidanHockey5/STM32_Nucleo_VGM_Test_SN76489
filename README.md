# STM32_Nucleo_VGM_Test_SN76489
Just playing around with a new STM32 board and programming in genuine C for STM32 sans Arduino. Nothin' serious here, but feel free to check it out! 

I'm using Atollic TrueSTUDIO, STM32CubeMX, and a little STM32 Nucleo-L452RE board. At the moment, I'm just having fun.
There are very few good resources on the native STM32 platform, so I thought I'd play around with something I'm familair with!
